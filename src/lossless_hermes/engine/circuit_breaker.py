"""Circuit-breaker state machine for compaction auth failures.

Hosts the :class:`CircuitBreaker` dataclass + transition methods used by
:class:`~lossless_hermes.engine.LCMEngine` to gate compaction calls when
the summarizer is failing with auth errors (Epic 04 wiring).

This module ships the **state-machine scaffold only** at issue 02-09:

* :class:`CircuitBreaker` dataclass with three states: ``closed`` (the
  default, all calls allowed), ``open`` (calls rejected with cooldown),
  ``half_open`` (single probe-call allowed; success transitions to
  closed, failure transitions back to open).
* Transition methods: :meth:`record_failure`, :meth:`record_success`,
  :meth:`is_open`, :meth:`transition_to`, :meth:`cooldown_remaining_s`.
* Concurrency-safe — uses :class:`threading.Lock` because callers may
  be on different event loops or thread pools (Hermes background
  ingestion + asyncio compaction).

Maps to ``lossless-claw/src/engine.ts`` lines 1782 (state field) and
1963-2016 (transition methods). The TS source has only two states
(closed / open with auto-reset on cooldown); we add an explicit
``half_open`` state to make the probe-allow semantics easier to reason
about under concurrent callers. Epic 04 will wire the real
``LcmProviderAuthError`` catch around the summarizer; this issue ships
the primitives only.

Per the issue spec, the threshold + cooldown come from
:class:`~lossless_hermes.db.config.LcmConfig` (``circuit_breaker_threshold``
defaults to 5; ``circuit_breaker_cooldown_ms`` defaults to 1_800_000 =
30 min). Callers pass these in to :func:`CircuitBreaker.__init__`.

Deferred to Epic 04 (the first real caller — Epic 02 has none)
----------------------------------------------------------------

The Pair Reviewer for issue 02-09 flagged two items that we deliberately
defer until Epic 04 wires the auth-failure catch around the summarizer.
Documenting them here so the next agent picks them up rather than
rediscovering them.

* **TODO(Epic 04): half_open multi-probe concurrency.** :meth:`is_open`
  performs the ``open → half_open`` transition under the breaker's
  internal lock, but the *probe call* itself runs outside the lock.
  Two concurrent callers can therefore both observe ``is_open() ==
  False`` for the same half-open state and both issue a probe against
  the (still potentially unhealthy) upstream — defeating the
  single-probe semantics. The TS source has the same race, but Epic 04
  callers should serialize the probe via an additional
  ``_half_open_probe_lock`` (or ``asyncio.Lock`` if the caller is
  async) before invoking the summarizer. The fix belongs with the
  caller (Epic 04 summarize.py wiring), not the primitive, because
  only the caller knows the probe boundary. Cross-reference engine.ts
  ``executeCompactionWithBreaker`` at line ~2040 for the TS shape.

* **TODO(Epic 04): half-threshold WARN log.** Epic 04 wants an early
  operator signal once consecutive failures cross ``threshold / 2``
  (i.e. "headed toward circuit-open"), distinct from the ``OPENED``
  WARN that fires on the threshold itself. We did not add it here
  because the primitives have no caller yet and adding a third log
  level would clutter the test surface. Suggested implementation:
  log INFO (or WARN) inside :meth:`record_failure` when
  ``self.failures == self.threshold // 2 + 1`` (the first failure
  past the halfway mark, fires exactly once per open cycle). Pair
  with a Prometheus/StatsD gauge in Epic 04 telemetry.

See:

* ``docs/adr/027-engine-splitting.md`` — engine package layout.
* ``docs/porting-guides/engine.md`` §"Circuit-breaker logic" — the TS
  algorithm being ported here.
* ``epics/02-engine-skeleton/02-09-circuit-breaker-scaffold.md`` — this
  issue's spec.

    """Per-key circuit breaker state machine.

    Tracks consecutive auth failures from the summarizer for a single
    breaker key (typically ``f"{provider}/{model}"`` or
    ``f"{session_id}:{provider}/{model}"`` — Epic 04 chooses the policy).
    Opens after ``threshold`` failures; while open, :meth:`is_open`
    returns ``True`` until the cooldown elapses. After cooldown,
    transitions to ``half_open`` to allow a single probe call; on
    success transitions to ``closed``, on failure transitions back to
    ``open`` with a fresh ``open_since`` timestamp.

            ``"half_open"``. Default ``"closed"``.

            success. The breaker opens when ``failures >= threshold``.

            most recent ``closed → open`` or ``half_open → open``
            transition. ``None`` when ``state != "open"``.
