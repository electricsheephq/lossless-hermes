"""Compaction methods for :class:`~lossless_hermes.engine.LCMEngine`.

Hosts the ``compress`` overflow-recovery entry point + the
``execute_compaction_core`` / ``compact_until_under`` /
``evaluate_incremental_compaction`` state-machine helpers per ADR-027
§Decision "Package structure" — the ``compact.py`` sub-module of
``src/lossless_hermes/engine/``.

At issue **02-05** ``should_compress`` carries real logic — the
conventional threshold gate plus an anti-thrashing back-off — while
``compress`` remains a passthrough (the noop compress refinement lands
in 02-06; the real compaction algorithm lands in Epic 04).

Maps to ``engine.ts`` ``compact()`` / ``executeCompactionCore`` (lines
7185-7243, 3344-3528) and ``evaluateIncrementalCompaction`` (2824-3002).
Hermes's own ``should_compress`` (agent/context_compressor.py:493-513)
is the closer kin — same threshold gate + ineffective-compression count.

Mixin contract (per ADR-027 §Consequences "All state lives on the shell
class"):

* No state owned here. Methods read/write
  ``self._compression_history``, ``self._circuit_breakers``,
  ``self._compaction_telemetry_store``, ``self._compaction_maintenance_store``,
  etc. exclusively via the shell class's attributes declared in
  :meth:`LCMEngine.__init__`.
* No cross-mixin imports. If compaction work needs assemble behavior,
  it goes through ``self.assemble(...)`` (MRO resolves to
  :class:`_AssembleMixin`).

Why ``compress`` and ``should_compress`` have bodies (not stubs):

* These are required ABC methods on :class:`ContextEngine` — they MUST
  be callable on a freshly-constructed engine. The 02-05 ``compress``
  passes every input through unchanged; 02-06 / Epic 04 fills in the
  refinement and the real compaction algorithm. Keeping the bodies
  here (rather than the shell class) means subsequent algorithm-fill
  issues touch one file.

See:

* ``docs/adr/024-project-layout.md`` — engine/ package placement.
* ``docs/adr/027-engine-splitting.md`` — mixin pattern decisions.
* ``docs/porting-guides/engine.md`` §"compact" — the TS algorithm that
  fills the heavy bodies in Epic 04.

        Per ``docs/reference/hermes-hooks.md`` line 51, called from

        cache-aware state machine lands in Epic 04. Issue 02-05 ships the
        **conventional threshold gate** + a simple anti-thrashing back-off.

        Algorithm:

        1. Resolve the observed token count: explicit ``prompt_tokens``
           arg if non-None, else ``self.last_prompt_tokens`` (set by
           :meth:`update_from_response`, landing in 02-04).
        2. **Threshold gate.** If ``self.threshold_tokens`` is 0 (never
           set — :meth:`update_model` hasn't fired) the gate returns
           ``False`` regardless of how high ``observed`` is. This guards
           the "default state" case: the engine must not fire compaction
           before the host wires the model context length. Otherwise the
           gate is ``observed >= self.threshold_tokens``.
        3. **Anti-thrashing back-off.** Inspect the last
           :data:`INEFFECTIVE_RUN_LENGTH` entries of
           ``self._compression_history`` (a ``deque[tuple[int, int]]`` of
           ``(before_tokens, after_tokens)`` pairs appended by
           :meth:`compress`). An entry is "ineffective" when its savings
           ratio ``(before - after) / before`` is less than
           :data:`INEFFECTIVE_SAVINGS_THRESHOLD` (10% — matches Hermes
           ``context_compressor.py`` line 1538-1543). If the most recent
           ``INEFFECTIVE_RUN_LENGTH`` entries are all ineffective, return
           ``False`` even at over-threshold tokens — the next pass would
           hot-loop with no real reduction.

        ADR-010 §Note — once the upstream ``preassemble`` patch lands
        (Hermes PR #24949 — patch #1 in ADR-015), LCM compaction will
        run via the always-on assembly hook + deferred debt queue, and
        ``should_compress`` will be redefined to always return ``False``
        (compaction no longer threshold-gated). Until then, the
        conventional threshold gate is the right shape.
